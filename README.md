# **DermaLab Sales Performance Analytics (Excel Project)**

## 📊 Project Overview

DermaLab Sales Performance Analytics is an **end-to-end data analysis project built in Microsoft Excel**, designed to simulate how a data analyst supports management in understanding **real business performance** in a multi-channel skincare retail context—not merely reporting numbers.

In this project, I position myself as an analyst who bridges **operational transaction data, financial analysis, and business decision-making**. The focus is not only on *how many units are sold*, but more importantly on *which products truly drive profit* and *what decisions should be taken based on the data*.

This project represents how I approach analytics work: structured, critical of assumptions, and oriented toward business impact.

## **🎯 Business Questions**

This project is designed to answer key business questions such as:

* Which products and categories are truly the most profitable?
* Do high-selling categories always generate the highest profit?
* How do sales and profit trends evolve over time?
* Which sales channels contribute the most to total revenue?

## **🗂 Dataset Description**

The analysis is based on **two interconnected simulated datasets**:

### **1. Skincare Sales Dataset**

* 1,000 sales transactions
* Period: July 2023 – October 2024
* Contains customer data, product details, transaction dates, sales channels, and payment methods

### **2. Cost Product Dataset**

* Contains cost structure information per product
* Used to calculate total cost and net profit
* Linked to the sales dataset via *Product Name*

> The datasets are simulated but designed to closely resemble real-world skincare retail operations.

## **🔄 Project Workflow**

### **1. Data Collection**

* Designed a **Sales Transaction Form** as a structured data input system
* Implemented **VBA automation** to store transactions into the sales database
* Automated calculation of derived variables, including:

  * Order ID
  * Delivery Time
  * Sales Revenue
  * Total Cost
  * Net Profit

### **2. Data Cleaning**

* Standardized date formats across transaction records
* Removed 33 duplicate records to maintain data integrity
* Handled missing values in Unit Price using LOOKUP from a reference price table
* Generated time-based and financial analysis variables

### **3. Data Analysis**

* Conducted **descriptive statistical analysis** to understand transaction and operational patterns
* Performed **One-Way ANOVA** to test differences in profitability across product categories
* Key finding: profitability differs **significantly** between product categories

### **4. Data Visualization**

* Built an interactive dashboard using Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts
* Core KPIs: Sales Revenue, Total Cost, Net Profit, Total Orders
* Visualized trends, category comparisons, sales channels, and payment methods
* Added slicers to enable dynamic data exploration

## **📈 Key Insights**

* Product profitability differs **significantly** across categories, meaning business performance cannot be evaluated based on sales volume alone
* The **Serum** category delivers the highest profit per transaction, making it a strong candidate for marketing and resource prioritization
* The **Cleanser** category shows the lowest margin, indicating the need for pricing or cost structure optimization
* Digital channels (Official Website and Marketplaces) contribute the majority of total revenue, highlighting the importance of digital-first sales strategies

**Decision Lens:**

These insights enable management to:

* Prioritize high-margin product categories for scaling
* Re-evaluate pricing and cost structures for low-margin categories
* Focus marketing and operational efforts on the most effective sales channels

## **👤 Analyst Perspective**

This project reflects my approach as a data analyst who values **clarity over complexity**—using analytical and statistical methods only when they meaningfully support business decisions.

Rather than building dashboards that are purely descriptive, I focus on how data can be translated into **objective, actionable insights** that support better decision-making.
